# Repository Analysis: kitty

## Overview
This repository implements **kitty**, a terminal‑based AI chat client with agent capabilities. It provides an interactive Text User Interface (TUI) built with **Ink** and **React**, allowing users to converse with OpenAI models directly from the command line. The tool also supports **plugins** and **agents**, enabling extensibility and automation of tasks such as file access, code generation, and more.

## Key Features
- **Interactive TUI** (`ChatUI`) for real‑time chat.
- **Agent system** (`AIAgent`, `AgentManager`) that can run autonomous workflows.
- **Plugin architecture** (`PluginManager`) for installing, enabling, disabling, and removing plugins.
- **Non‑interactive mode** for piping input or passing a query directly.
- **Debug mode** (`--debug`) to show tool calls and results.
- **Token management** (`TokenManager`) to handle token limits.
- **Project context** handling for file system interactions.
- Built with **Bun** (fast JavaScript runtime) and **TypeScript**.

## Repository Structure
```
.
├─ src/                     # Main source code (TypeScript)
│   ├─ index.ts            # CLI entry point – parses arguments, launches UI or agents
│   ├─ ui.ts               # Ink‑based UI components
│   ├─ agent.ts            # Core AI agent implementation
│   ├─ agent-manager.ts    # Manages multiple agents
│   ├─ plugin-manager.ts   # Handles plugin lifecycle
│   ├─ orchestrator.ts     # Coordinates interactions between agents, plugins, UI
│   ├─ token-manager.ts    # Token budgeting and counting
│   ├─ project-context.ts  # Provides file‑system context to agents
│   ├─ ai-service.ts       # Wrapper around OpenAI API calls
│   ├─ tools/              # Utility modules (executor, gitignore utils, sbom tools, etc.)
│   └─ *.ts                # Additional supporting modules (plugins.ts, etc.)
├─ package.json            # Metadata, scripts, dependencies
├─ bun.lockb               # Bun lock file
└─ node_modules/           # Dependencies (not part of source analysis)
```

## Important Scripts (from `package.json`)
- `dev` – Run the source directly with Bun.
- `build` – Compile TypeScript to `dist/`.
- `start` – Execute the built CLI.
- `plugin:*` – Manage plugins (`list`, `install`, etc.).
- `agent:*` – Manage agents (`demo`, etc.).
- `demo` – Example usage scripts.
- `install:global` – Install the CLI globally.
- Version bump scripts (`version:patch`, `version:minor`, `version:major`).

## Observations
- The repository lacks a top‑level `README.md` and `LICENSE`, which are important for users and contributors.
- Documentation is primarily embedded in the CLI help output and source comments.
- The codebase is well‑structured with clear separation of concerns (UI, agents, plugins, utilities).
- Uses modern TypeScript features and relies on Bun for fast execution.
- The `tools/` directory contains reusable utilities such as an executor for running commands and gitignore handling.

## Recommendations
1. **Add a README** that explains the purpose, installation steps, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
2. **Include a LICENSE** (e.g., MIT) to clarify legal usage.
3. Consider adding **typedoc** generated API documentation for developers who want to extend the project.
4. Provide **example plugin** and **agent** implementations to illustrate extensibility.
5. Document the environment requirements (Bun version) and any optional dependencies.
